# imdb-movie-search
A simple search using IMDB's public rest api made with bootstrap.

Using Axios HTTP I was able to use the text input field in the index.html to get JSON data from the public API and was then able to
use JQuery to show the results.

I used a customized css file from Bootswatch to easily change the look and feel of the Bootsrap components I am using to display
the content.
